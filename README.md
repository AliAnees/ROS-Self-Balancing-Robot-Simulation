# ROS Self Balancing Robot Simulation
 In this project, a self balancing robot was simulated through the use of `ROS` enviornment, and `Python` and `C++` languages. A "TeeterBot" was used as a baseline for the project. The model was redesigned using `SOLIDWORKS`, and the PID controller was redesigned using `MATLAB` code and implemented into `Python` for use in the ROS environment.
